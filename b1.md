## This Session

### Reflecting Design Features of Digital Media and the Internet

* (Commercial) Internet Platforms

* Digital Communication

* Additional Findings from Empirical Research

### Kicking Off Our Design Process

## (Commercial) Internet Platforms

* Engagement Time Optimization

--

<br>

* Adaptive Content

--

<br>

* Specific to Social Platforms: The 1% rule, most users are lurkers (Van Mierlo, 2014)

---

## Digital Communication in Networks

* Asynchronicity and Hyperpersonalization
	* Hyperpersonal model of communication and effects on social anxiety 
	(High & Caplan, 2009)

--

* Media Richness and Social Cooperation
	* Group cooperation tasks across media types (Bos et al., 2002)

--

* Frictionless Navigation of Social Conflict and Disagreement
	* User filtration and polarization (John & Dvir-Gvirsman)
	* Alternative standpoints on polarization:
		* Filter bubbles (Pariser, 2011)
		* Cognition (e.g. confirmation bias) in combination
		with social *and* technological filtering (Geschke, Lorenz, and Holtz, 2019)
	
---

## Additional Findings from Empirical Research

* Elaboration likelihood model (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986)
	* There are prerequisites to elaboration

--

* Confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998)
	* Weighing evidence is not easy 

--

* Illusory Truth Effect (Fazio et al., 2015)
	* False claims can displace what we know

---

## Additional Findings from Empirical Research

* Prominence-Interpretation Theory (Fogg, 2003):
	* A close investigation of the source does not come naturally
--

<br>

* Fake news spread more effeciently (Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral, 2018)
	* Potentially due to strong emotional reactions connected to the nature of false claims

---

## Questions and Group Reflection

Questions to reflect:

* How does information flow differently online than offline?

* What are differences in the way people interact online and offline?

* Which consequences arise?

* How would we like to address these consequences?
