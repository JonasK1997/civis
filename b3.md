## This Session

* About service learning and the CIVIS values

* Prototyping

* Group discussion

* Prototype merging

## Learning Goals of this Panel

*After introducing the idea of service learning, participants design final prototypes of a platform of consensual communication. In the plenum, we try to merge these prototypes into one final product.*

<br>

* Integrating the idea of Service learning into our project

* Finalizing one coherent version of the online platform

## Prototyping

**Breakout Rooms + Conceptboard**

* Design a visual platform prototype

* Back the prototype with the theoretical and applied knowledge discussed thus far

Potential questions to reflect:

* Why should people use the platform?

* What functionality would you, as a potential user, like the platform to have?

* How can language and design embody community values?

* How might artificial intelligence enhance the platform?
