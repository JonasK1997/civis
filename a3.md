## Learning Goals of this Panel

*Having integrated our perspective on society on the pandemic and after identifying conflicting actors in discourse, the upcoming panel will deal with communication theory. What is communication? What are obstacles to effective communication and what are possible solutions?*

<br>

* Participants learn about communication and its obstacles and can apply this to personal situations

* Participants get introduced into the idea of “Pragma-Dialectics” as a possible solution to communication dilemmas

---

## Structure of This Input

1st part: Communication in Systems view vs. Orator view

2nd part: Obstacles for a successful orator

3rd part: Pragma-Dialectics and 6 Rules for a critical discussion 

---
## Systems View vs. Orator View

* We are all part of interconnected systems, but still individuals with particular opinions

* Convincing another discussant of the correctness of a standpoint is part of the process of forming consensus

* Rhetorical action: a thin line between manipulation and persuasion

> “Those who ‘manipulate’, we can say, have secret goals,
> do not act openly, and communicate using tricks. Such communicative action
> must be excluded from real rhetoric, which is by definition always tied to
> socially acceptable means.” (Knape 2013: 6)

## Who is an Orator? (Lat.: “speaker”) 

“A person is considered an orator when he/she has a goal (a telos), which he believes to be justified and which he seeks to achieve through communication” (Knape 2013: 6)

* In our discussions each of you is to be considered an Orator!

---

## What do <u>you</u> as an orator perceive as obstacles in communication?

Take 5 mins to discuss in small groups. Consider our brainstorming in A2 as well as personal experiences.


---

## Obstacles for a Successful Orator

<b>Situative resistance: (Knape 2013: 8)</b>

* Hostile audience that distracts from the communicative purpose

* Recent events that might let the topic appear inappropriate 


---

## Obstacles for a Successful Orator

<b>Medial resistance: (Knape 2013: 8)</b>

* Loss and distortion of information through different media 

* Communication over distances needs a medium → such might limit the possibilities of the orator (e.g. telephone → just audio)

* Absence of face-to-face communication; communication online (in case of an online-forum)

---


## Obstacles for a Successful Orator


<b>Linguistic/ textual resistance: (Knape 2013: 8)</b>

* Expectations of conventional forms must be fulfilled for successful communication

* Orator is bound to: 
  * The grammatical structure of a language
  * Socio-cultural norms of addressees 

---

## Obstacles for a Successful Orator

<b>Cognitive resistance: (Knape 2013: 9)</b>

* Each person is a closed cognitive system 

* Projective calculation: Orator must imagine himself/herself in the psyche of the audience to meet their needs

* Differences in behavior and mentality (e.g. emotions) can distort communication  

---

## Obstacles for a Successful Orator

<b>Recap on ideologies:</b>

* Allegory of the Cave → Perspective and experience differ through and make up distinct worldviews 

* Pictures of “the good society” and “truth” vary across different ideologies
 
How can two different ideologies prove the accuracy of their own judgements and the falseness of the others by argument? → Ineffective communication is to be expected.

---

## Agreeing on a Common Ground 

* Implementing dynamic thinking in practice → dynamic relationism
 
* We may not agree on a distinct truth as starting point, but we can agree on a way of mutual “truth”-finding → embrace different standpoints and one’s own particularity

* Need for a “common ground” in discussion that allows proper argumentation

---

## A Quick Introduction to Pragma-Dialectics

<b>Suggesting Pragma-Dialectics:</b> (van Eemeren et al. 2014: 528)

* Model of a critical discussion

* Theoretically motivated idealization, not an utopia
 
* Vital guidance for people who wish to resolve differences by means of argumentative discourse

<b>Argumentation?!</b>

“Argumentation is a verbal, social, and rational activity aimed at convincing 
a reasonable critic of the acceptability of a standpoint by putting forward a 
constellation of propositions justifying or refuting the proposition expressed 
in the standpoint” (van Eemeren and Grootendorst 2004: 1).
 
---

## Rules for a Critical Discussion

* For effective communication we need a structure that ensures its quality

* Based on the pragma-dialectical approach (van Eemeren and Grootendorst 2004: 135-157) we propose 6 Rules for our upcoming discussions


---

## Rules for a Critical Discussion

* Freedom of speech
  
  * Every discussant is free to defend or doubt a certain standpoint

* Burden of proof

  * Who puts forward a standpoint is committed to defend it

---

## Rules for Critical Discussion

* Commitment to reference

  * An attempted refutation has to refer to the standpoint that has actually been put forward by the counterparty

* Topic relatedness

  * A standpoint has to be defended only by proper argumentation (e.g. not by appeal to authority) 

---

## Rules for Critical Discussion

* Usage of plausible argumentation schemes

  * The justification of a standpoint has to consist of arguments that fit together 

* Acceptance of the result

  * If the justification of a standpoint has occurred in line with the discussion rules the discutants have to accept the standpoint as justified
