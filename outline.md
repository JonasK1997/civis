# Summary

In a two-day seminar, participants will challenge their pre-existing ideas on what effective communication between different opinions means. Our inquiry will be guided by differing perspectives towards the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In utilizing the lens of Systems Thinking and communication theories, we identify common practices and obstacles of communication, with special focus on the digital world. The goal of this service learning workshop is to transfer this theoretical lense to approach new avenues of communication that enable productive discussion between different opinions under a common set of community rules and values. Specifically, we aim at building a new online community in which controversies can be discussed by everyone - potentially building new common ground. Ultimately, we want to offer insight into differing opinions and their discussion can actually foster change in society for greater good.

# A1 Communication and society as a System?

We start our seminar off with important theoretical frameworks and questions that will guide our inquiry. What do we mean when we talk about "society" as a system? How can actors and communication inside of systems be conceptualized and analyzed? What cultural and interpersonal norms play a role in communication between systems? Informed by an interdisciplinary theory-framework participants will receive an interactive and brief introduction into systems and communication theory and relate these concepts to their own day-to-day experience.


# A2 (Our) Perspectives on the pandemic

The second session of the day is designed to be of interactive and creative nature. Uncovering the topic on which we will apply the theories discussed in section A1, we will brainstorm pieces of public discourse and relevant groups in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We will compare and contrast our preconceptions and experiences with the pandemic across nations and define questions to analyze and answer in later sections of the workshop.


# A3 Obstacles and rhetoric foundations in communication

This section of our workshop will try to answer the question on how to actually implement effective communication after having analyzed public discourse and groups participating in it. In other words: How can communication go wrong and what can we expect when communicating with groups with diverse opinions, values and backgrounds? The aim of this section is to prepare our considerations for the creation of a new digital network.


# A4 Transfer: How to build a digital network (fast)

Bringing together the sessions of the first day, we want to take a step back and summarize new insights that participants made and share them with everyone. As a bridge to the second day, we aim at posing the question: How can we create a new digital community that builds a common ground despite controversy? We will talk about foundational design principles, features and rules that should govern such a community.



# B1 Design and Implementation I

To start off our second day, we aim at addressing features of digital communication that are different from in vivo communication. Therefore, we will first offer a small theoretical input on digital media and machine learning in order to derive implications for the new digital network we want to build. Ultimately, we want to discuss the impact of the digital world on communication and information - and how to harness its potential for productive discussion. The goal of this session is to design a visual prototype that showcases how our digital network will look like.


# B2 A common set of rules?

This session aims to exchange ideas on how a digital community would have to be designed in order to integrate the communication principles we have accumulated. We will revisit our findings from A4 and investigate the questions of accessibility, moderators and rules. Does our digital network even need rules? How can rules be consensual, considering the diverse cultural and social backgrounds of the participants inside our digital network?


# B3 Design and Implementation II 	

How can the results of session B2 be summarized and implemented in detail? How can our digital network be introduced to several European University initiatives, actualizing the CIVIS goals? This session will give participants additional room to come up with their own ideas and additions to our model of a new digital network. We will attempt to have a final visual prototype of our digital network.

 
# B4 Wrapping up - Next Steps

First, this final session will be a room for presenting and discussing our visual prototype of our digital network. Secondly, we will discuss next steps and how to keep on working on the implementation of our digital network beyond our workshop. Thirdly, similar to session A4, this session aims at making each participant¿s insights transparent to our group and to give enough space to integrate new ideas and concepts.
